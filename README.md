# Keylogger

Simple keylogger in python sending logged keys to a txt file after the script terminates. 
Additionally i made a payload with msfvenom in kali linux that was sent to the "victim" allowing access to activate the keylogger and read from the "victims" disk.

### *This was all made for educational purposes as a part of project for a university course
